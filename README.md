# Unity Projects
Games and projects made in Unity.

1. **ANN_Q_ballanceBall**
  * This is a simple project showing the use of the Q-Learning algorithm. The platform control script uses the Q-Learning algorithm to keep the ball on the platform.
  
2. **BlockBreaker**
  * Contains a game created in the style of arkanoid.

3. **CannonBall**
  * Hyper casual game prototype. Based on the use of cannons and bows to reach maximum height by the projectile.
  
4. **GenericAlgorithms3D**
  * A project showing the use of a genetic algorithm to control an agent.

5. **Machine**
  * Hyper casual game prototype. Based on the mechanics of metalworking using a lathe.

6. **MapGeneration**
  * A simple project showing the possibility of generating a mesh using a script.

7. **Q_Learning_CarControll**
  * An advanced project showing the possibilities of controlling a vehicle using three implemented machine learning algorithms.

8. **Slider**
  * Project of a simple game that uses effects based on sound and collisions of objects.

9. **SpaceHeroes**
  * A game project based on the theme of space, gravity, astronomy and star wars. Using a physics engine to calculate interactions between planets.

10. **UnitySDK**
  * A project containing the implementation of air resistance physics and an example of its use.
  * The project also includes examples of how to train an agent using the implemented air resistance. The agent's learning model was based on the ML-Agents tool.
  * Based on Unity ML-Agents project.* https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents
